## Purpose
I designed ConfigWizard to help create configs for minecraft models. There are a few common minecraft model plugins you can use for furniture/items, ex. Oraxen and Itemsadder. Creating the configuration files to actually add them into the game can be a VERY manuel process especially when you have 10s of models to add. That is what inspired me to create this app, to quickly add furnitures and generate a YML file. Me and some others used it for our group minecraft server, and it has been used commercially on multiple packages in my MCModels store [https://mcmodels.net/vendors/111/williamqm] You can try it out here: [configwizard.vercel.app/maker]
